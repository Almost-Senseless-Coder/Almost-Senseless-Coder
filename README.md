# Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## Whois

I'm a legally deafblind computer science student and software developer, mostly in the  web context (both frontend and backend).

## Interests

- Accessibility (Naturally specializising in accessibility for the blind/deafblind, but I'm trying to stay up-to-date with other accessibility aspects as well.)
- App development (All platforms)
- FOSS
- Privacy
- Programming language design
- Software security (I'm more on the blue team myself.)

## Programming languages

- Rust
- PHP
- JavaScript
- Java
- Quorum
- Inform 7

I know a bunch of other programming languages (Python, Lua, LPC, C++, ...) but would have to polish my knowledge first before I could put them to good use again.

## Frameworks

- [Yew](https://yew.rs)
- [Tauri](https://tauri.studio)
